# Experiment in Electrical Technology & Electrical Engineering

This is a course I attended at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications during the 2021-2022 academic year.

The `Docs` folder contains the lab reports written in Chinese for each experiment:

1. Verification of Kirchhoff's Laws and Superposition Theorem
2. Experimental Verification of Thevenin's Theorem and Norton's Theorem on The Volt Ampere Characteristics of Linear and Nonlinear Resistors
3. The Usage Methods of Commonly Used Electronic Instruments and The Step Response of First-Order Circuits
4. Research on Frequency Characteristics of Transmission Networks and RLC Series Resonant Circuits
5. Crystal Diodes and Their Basic Applications
6. Design of Transistor Common Emitter Amplification Circuit

Details of the experiments can be found in the `Docs` folder.
